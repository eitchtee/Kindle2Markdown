# Kindle2MD

A simple CLI tool to convert your Kindle "My Clippings.txt" file into a set of organized markdown files, one for each book.

**This tool is designed to work with clippings in Portuguese**, but it can be adapted for other languages (issues and pull requests for other languages are welcome. Share your My Clippings file). It automatically fetches book covers, deduplicates highlights, and generates clean markdown files ready for use in note-taking apps like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Features

- **Markdown Conversion**: Parses `My Clippings.txt` and generates individual markdown files for each book.
- **Cover Fetching**: Automatically fetches book covers from [bookcover API](https://github.com/w3slley/bookcover-api/i) and Google Books API.
- **Placeholder Covers**: Generates placeholder covers from [placehold.co](https://placehold.co) if no official cover is found.
- **Efficient Processing**: Caches covers locally and skips files that are already up-to-date to speed up later runs.
- **Deduplication**: Optionally removes duplicate highlights, keeping only the most recent one for each position.
- **Smart Parsing**:
    - Handles various author formats (e.g., `Last, First`, multiple authors separated by `;`, `&`, or `and`).
    - Correctly parses clippings metadata, including page, position, and date.
    - Currently optimized for clippings in Portuguese.
- **Customizable Output**:
    - Allows custom date formatting in the output files.
    - Generates clean, readable markdown with YAML frontmatter, perfect for Obsidian vaults.
